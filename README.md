# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program - Weekwise Submissions

This repository hosts **week-wise submissions** for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** at **IIT Gandhinagar**. 
The program is a 20-week initiative that provides hands-on experience in designing and fabricating a RISC-V System on a Chip (SoC), from RTL design to post-silicon validation, using **Synopsys tools**.
